# maze-lambda
rust maze generation on aws lambda using the serverless framework

leverages the core API from [animate-object/mazes](https://github.com/animate-object/mazes), shared with the [maze-cli](https://github.com/animate-object/maze-cli) project.

this lambda primarily will primarily serve my upcoming maze web game project. Now that it's reached an MVP stage, development will be on the backburner in favor of completing the web client.
